Hi, I’m looking to get some information about auto insurance. I just bought a new car, and I need coverage.

Of course! I’d be happy to help you with that. Can I have your name and the make and model of the car?

Sure, my name is David Mason. The car is a 2021 Honda Accord, and I just picked it up yesterday.

Great! Congratulations on the new car, David. Let me pull up some options for you. Do you have any specific coverage in mind, or are you looking for suggestions?

I’m mostly interested in liability and comprehensive coverage. I’ve had a policy before, but I need to transfer it over to the new car.

Got it. We offer a few different options. Liability coverage will protect you if you're at fault in an accident, while comprehensive covers things like theft, vandalism, and weather damage. I can also help you with collision coverage, which will cover damages to your car in an accident, even if you’re the one who caused it. Does that sound good?

Yeah, I think that’s exactly what I need. What are the deductibles for collision and comprehensive coverage?

For collision, we typically offer a $500 or $1,000 deductible, and for comprehensive, you can choose between a $250, $500, or $1,000 deductible. The deductible is the amount you'll pay out of pocket before the insurance starts covering the rest of the costs. 

Okay, I’ll go with the $500 deductible for both. What would my monthly premium be with those options?

Let me run the numbers based on your car and the coverage you've chosen. Your monthly premium would be approximately $135, including liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage with a $500 deductible.

That sounds reasonable. Can I get the full policy details sent to my email for review?

Sure thing! What’s the best email address for you? 

It’s david.mason@email.com.

Got it, David. I’ll send you the full policy details right away. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Actually, I just had an accident last night. My car got scratched up when I was parked at the grocery store. Someone must’ve hit it while I wasn’t around. I’d like to file a claim.

I’m sorry to hear about the scratch. Let’s get that claim started for you. Can you tell me a little more about the damage?

Yeah, it looks like someone scraped the rear bumper on the driver’s side. It’s not a huge dent, but it’s noticeable. I’ve got a few photos I took of the damage. Should I send them to you?

Yes, please email me the photos of the damage. It will help us assess the situation faster. Do you have a police report, or was anyone around when it happened?

No, there was no police report filed, and I didn’t see anyone at the scene. It seems like a hit-and-run, so I didn’t get any information from the other party.

Got it. I’ll go ahead and open a claim for you based on your comprehensive coverage, since it covers vandalism and hit-and-runs. Once we receive the photos, we’ll assign an adjuster to inspect the damage and determine the cost of repairs.

Okay, I’ll email the photos right away. How long will it take for the claim to be processed?

Once we receive the photos and open the claim, the adjuster will reach out within 2-3 business days to schedule an inspection. The whole process typically takes about 5-10 business days, depending on the extent of the damage.

Sounds good. Is there anything else I need to do?

Just make sure to send those photos over, and we’ll take it from there. If the adjuster needs anything else, they’ll contact you directly. 

Okay, I’ll get those sent right now. Thanks for your help.

You’re welcome, David! I’ll make sure the claim gets processed quickly. Feel free to reach out if you need anything else.

Thanks again! I’ll keep an eye out for the policy email as well.

No problem. Have a great day, and let us know if you need further assistance!

You too, bye!
